EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

Import tkinter: Imports the tkinter library under the alias tk.
draw_line function: Defines a function draw_line that draws a line on the canvas between two points.
change_color function: Defines a function change_color that changes the current drawing color.
Initialize tkinter: Creates the main window (Tk()), sets its title.
Create Canvas widget: Creates a canvas widget (Canvas) where drawing will happen.
Create color buttons: Creates buttons for selecting different drawing colors.
Initialize drawing variables: Sets initial drawing color and previous coordinates.
Bind mouse event: Binds left mouse button motion ("<B1-Motion>") to the draw_line function.
Run the application: Enters the tkinter main event loop (mainloop()) to start the GUI application.
